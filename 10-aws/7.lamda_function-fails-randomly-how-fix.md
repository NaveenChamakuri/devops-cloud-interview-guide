when the labda function is invoked it perform https requests and RDS, s3 activity

--because of this foellow the steps
  - I enable the tracing(in aws X-ray function) this gives complete jerney of understnding
  - will check the 'call latency'-which region sharing the ebs,db or other service
  -increase the no.of retries for this run a loop -it gives failing less
  -finding the latency use 'timeout'

still issue was the issue i mostly prefer to rewright the labdafunction
