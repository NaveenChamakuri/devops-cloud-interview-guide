  - first i recreate the service, fortunately these have the backup mechanism.
  - for S3 have 'versioning' -i will go with previous version&create new s3, defenitely some data is losed
  - RDS have 'pont-in-time' - iwill restore aws RDS
  -ec2 i use the snapshot&recreate the new&particuler ami and attach the snapshot to the ami

for the long-term solution

  -work on 'Rbac,IAM'-it is good approch to 0 privilege,
  - create IAM policy to provide a right access to the right users
  - i will work on a IAAC 'Terraform' and it should be integrated with vcs GIT for proper auditing as well as proper version contolling of the scripts.
