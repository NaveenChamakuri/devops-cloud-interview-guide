for this issue i follow the steps
  1. this moment some users are blocked, i need to unblock them for this-- i create a snapshot&increase the Rds bigger than previous.
  2. i create a script for AG.

for the logterm solutions

  1. I will check DB,tables,objects to identify which is more data consuming 
    "SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('DATABASE_NAME'))"
  2. i will inform to DEV or Database admin for resolve this issue not repeating again
  3. to avoid the failure -i create metrices in 'Cloudwatch' (aws'freestoragespace' it gives the info rds about to full)
