for this issue i follow the steps
  -this moment some users are blocked, ineed to unblock themfor this-- i create a snapshot&increase the Rds bigger than previous.
  -i create a script for AG.

for the logterm solutions

  - I will check DB,tables,objects to identify which is more data consuming 
    "SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('DATABASE_NAME'))"
  -i will inform to DEV or Database admin for resolve this issue not repeating again
  - to avoid the failure -i create metrices in 'Cloudwatch' (aws'freestoragespace' it gives the info rds about to full)
