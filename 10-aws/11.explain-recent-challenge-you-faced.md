recently i faced the challenge with AES code-commite, aws is anounced deprecation of code-commite and we are majorly impacted with code-commite and we are 200+ commits ona repo, we heavily depended on aws devops services like code-pipeline,code-commite. we decide to migrate the services to github repo
 -we are compare the various repository revices decided to github, because it providing the lot of services and proper 'ecosystem'management
 - i created a dashboard in this dashboard i actegerised all repos like 1.less impact repo 2.critical impact and 3.important or more critical . first we migrate less impact thencritical impact and finally important repo.almost 4-5 months i worked and zero impact on these process.
