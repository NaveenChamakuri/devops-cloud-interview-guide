recently i faced the challenge with AwS code-commite, aws is anounced deprecation of code-commite and we are majorly impacted with code-commite and we are 200+ commits and repo's, we heavily depended on aws devops services like code-pipeline,code-commite. we decide to migrate the services to github repo
 -we are compare the various repository services, decided to github, because it providing the lot of services and proper 'ecosystem'management
 - i created a dashboard, in this dashboard i categerised all repos like 1.less impact repo 2.critical impact and 3.important or more critical . first we migrate less impact then critical impact and finally important repo.almost 4-5 months i worked and zero impact on these process.



clone the repo from aws code-commite to local --> git clone --bare code-commite url
configure the git credintials on local m/c
push the repo to git hub --> push --mirror github-url
