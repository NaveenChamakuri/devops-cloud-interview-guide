NACL will work on subnet level and SG will work on servece level

generally nacl->network access contole 
by deafault s/n are interact with other in same VPC. nacl us used to deny the trafic each other, here nacl control the traffic to the perticuler s/n   through the ip
SG are used to allow the traffic to particular vm in a s/n through the particular port.
in a s/n have mutliple vms,some vm's need too alow the port80, some are not needed,at thet time both nacl+sg will work togather
