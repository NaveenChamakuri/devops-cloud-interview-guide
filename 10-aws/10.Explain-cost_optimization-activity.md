as a devops engineer cost optimization is a part of my day to day activity
  - identify the unused ebs voluems and delete those voluems- some of completely unused, some of unused from last 1 yearsome of have the snapshots
  -first i used 'aws cli to identify the ec2 'describe-volueme' after thet i realized and start to use lamda functions
  -when i moved to lamda_function i write a python script, for indentify the unused files i uesd 'boto3'and iam using to deleting the unused files boto3 itself
  -i setup a 'periodically' this will be exicuted every 4th of the month, this will reduce the cost significantly

other
  - ebs: gp2,gp3 here gp2 stands for older&provideng hiegh cost and gp3 is a latest& providing low cost,i will moved ebs form gp2>gp3
  - for this i wrote a script in python module using the boto3
