------have heard about opentofu and do u think it is better then terraform.

-both opentofu and share ther roots.opentofu is actually created from teeraform, because of licensing change
-i our org we use terraform to create internal infra,we are not impacted with licensing change, we go with hasicorp terraform because we have lot files are in terraform.

-as personally i learned opentofu, i am ready to wirk with opetofu as per requirement
