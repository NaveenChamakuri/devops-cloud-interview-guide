----have you considered storing astatefile in git instead of aws_s3 or Azure_blob.

-when u create resource in aws using the terraform,terraform creates the statefile to store the info about the resource u created such as resource id, metadata, ip, dependencies and alo last_known_state of infrau.this info is not only important and sensitive info of the organization 
- this info is not possible to store in local of each devops engineer and it not possible to store in git,because the repo is public every-one use this info, even the repo is private no.of people will access with in the org.
-to avoid this state-file stores in remote-backend services like aws-s3 or azure-bob, for this defin a remotebackend.tf and provide the details of remotebackend such as name, region and othe info,then terraform will store the statefile in remotebackend.
-with in the remote-backend enable 'versioning', then it also act as vcs 
-you can enable security to ur statefile is secure, strict Rbac and policies
-enable the Backup and locking the statefile with in the remote-backed
-locking is used to avoid the multiple devops engineers create same ec2-instance or other services
